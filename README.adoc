Explore how to use bean validation to validate user input data for microservices.

== What you'll learn

You will learn the basics of writing and testing a microservice that uses bean 
validation and the new functionality of Bean Validation 2.0. The service uses
bean validation to validate that the supplied JavaBeans meet the defined 
constraints.

Bean Validation is a Java specification that simplifies data validation and error 
checking. Bean validation uses a standard way to validate data stored in 
JavaBeans. Validation can be performed manually or with integration with other 
specifications and frameworks, such as Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI), 
Java Persistence API (JPA), or JavaServer Faces (JSF). To set rules on data, apply 
constraints by using annotations or XML configuration files. Bean validation 
provides both built-in constraints and the ability to create custom constraints. 
Bean validation allows for validation of both JavaBean fields and methods. For 
method-level validation, both the input parameters and return value can be 
validated.

Several additional built-in constraints are included in Bean Validation 2.0, 
which reduces the need for custom validation in common validation scenarios. 
Some of the new built-in constraints include `@Email`, `@NotBlank`, `@Positive`, 
and `@Negative`. Also in Bean Validation 2.0, you can now specify constraints 
on type parameters.

The example microservice uses both field-level and method-level validation as well 
as several of the built-in constraints and a custom constraint.

Once your application is up and running, open another command-line session by selecting **Terminal** > **New Terminal** 
from the menu of the IDE. Then use the following command to get the URL.
Open your browser and check out your service by going to the URL that the command returns.

read https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-openapi.html[Documenting RESTful APIs^]. 
Expand the `/beanvalidation/validatespacecraft POST request to validate your spacecraft bean` section 
and click `Try it out`. Copy the following example input into the text box:

[role='command']
```
{
  "astronaut": {
    "name": "Libby",
    "age": 25,
    "emailAddress": "libbybot@openliberty.io"
  },
  "destinations": {
    "Mars": 500
  },
  "serialNumber": "Liberty0001"
}
```

Click `Execute` and you receive the response `No Constraint Violations` because the 
values specified pass the constraints you will create in this guide. Now try copying
the following value into the box:

[role='command']
```
{
  "astronaut": {
    "name": "Libby",
    "age": 12,
    "emailAddress": "libbybot@openliberty.io"
  },
  "destinations": {
    "Mars": 500
  },
  "serialNumber": "Liberty0001"
}
```

This time you receive `Constraint Violation Found: must be greater than or equal to 18` as 
a response because the age specified was under the minimum age of 18. Try 
other combinations of values to get a feel for the constraints that will be defined 
in this guide.

First, create the JavaBeans to be constrained.

#Create the `Astronaut` class.#

Astronaut.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']

----

The bean stores the attributes of an astronaut, [hotspot=Name file=0]`name`, [hotspot=age file=0]`age`, 
and [hotspot=emailAddress file=0]`emailAddress`, and provides getters and setters to access and set 
the values.

The [hotspot=Astronaut file=0]`Astronaut` class has the following constraints applied:

* The astronaut needs to have a name. Bean Validation 2.0 provides a built-in [hotspot=not-blank file=0]`@NotBlank` constraint, which ensures the value is not null and contains one character that isn't a blank space. The annotation constrains the [hotspot=Name file=0]`name` field.

* The email supplied needs to be a valid email address. Another built-in constraint in Bean Validation 2.0 is [hotspot=Email file=0]`@Email`, which can validate that the [hotspot=Astronaut file=0]`Astronaut` bean includes a correctly formatted email address. The annotation constrains the [hotspot=emailAddress file=0]`emailAddress` field.

* The astronaut needs to be between 18 and 100 years old. Bean validation allows you to specify multiple constraints on a single field. The [hotspot=Min file=0]`@Min` and [hotspot=Max file=0]`@Max` built-in constraints applied to the [hotspot=age file=0]`age` field check that the astronaut is between the ages of 18 and 100.

In this example, the annotation is on the field value itself. You can also place the 
annotation on the getter method, which has the same effect.

#Create the `Spacecraft` class.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/beanvalidation/Spacecraft.java`
---- 

Spacecraft.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/beanvalidation/Spacecraft.java[]
----

The [hotspot=Spacecraft file=1]`Spacecraft` bean contains 3 fields, [hotspot=Astronaut file=1]`astronaut`, 
[hotspot=serialNumber file=1]`serialNumber`, and [hotspot=Map file=1]`destinations`. The JavaBean 
needs to be a CDI managed bean to allow for method-level validation, which uses CDI 
interceptions. Because the [hotspot=Spacecraft file=1]`Spacecraft` bean is a CDI managed bean, 
a scope is necessary. A request scope is used in this example. To learn more about CDI, see 
https://openliberty.io/guides/cdi-intro.html[Injecting dependencies into microservices^].

The [hotspot=Spacecraft file=1]`Spacecraft` class has the following constraints applied:

* Every destination that is specified needs a name and a positive distance. In Bean Validation 2.0, you can specify constraints on type parameters. The [hotspot=Map file=1]`@NotBlank` and [hotspot=Map file=1]`@Positive` annotations constrain the [hotspot=Map file=1]`destinations` map so that the destination name is not blank, and the distance is positive. The [hotspot=Map file=1]`@Positive` constraint ensures that numeric value fields are greater than 0.

* A correctly formatted serial number is required. In addition to specifying the built-in constraints, you can create custom constraints to allow user-defined validation rules. The [hotspot=serial-num file=1]`@SerialNumber` annotation that constrains the [hotspot=serialNumber file=1]`serialNumber` field is a custom constraint, which you will create later.

Because you already specified constraints on the [hotspot=Astronaut file=0]`Astronaut` bean, 
the constraints do not need to be respecified in the [hotspot=Spacecraft file=1]`Spacecraft` 
bean. Instead, because of the [hotspot=Valid file=1]`@Valid` annotation on the field, all 
the nested constraints on the [hotspot=Astronaut file=0]`Astronaut` bean are validated.

You can also use bean validation with CDI to provide method-level validation. The
[hotspot=launchSpacecraft file=1]`launchSpacecraft()` method on the [hotspot=Spacecraft file=1]`Spacecraft` 
bean accepts a [hotspot=launchCode file=1]`launchCode` parameter, and if the [hotspot=launchCode file=1]`launchCode` 
parameter is [hotspot=OpenLiberty file=1]`OpenLiberty`, the method returns [hotspot=true file=1]`true` 
that the spacecraft is launched. Otherwise, the method returns [hotspot=false file=1]`false`. 
The [hotspot=launchSpacecraft file=1]`launchSpacecraft()` method uses both parameter and return value 
validation. The [hotspot=launchCode file=1]`@NotNull` constraint eliminates the need to manually 
check within the method that the parameter is not null. Additionally, the method has the 
[hotspot=AssertTrue file=1]`@AssertTrue` return-level constraint to enforce that the method must 
return the `true` boolean.

// ==================================================================================
// Creating custom constraints
// ==================================================================================
== Creating custom constraints

To create the custom constraint for [hotspot=serial-num file=0]`@SerialNumber`, begin by creating 
an annotation.

Spacecraft.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/beanvalidation/Spacecraft.java[]
----

[role='code_command hotspot file=1', subs='quotes']
---- 
#Replace the annotation.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/beanvalidation/SerialNumber.java`
---- 

SerialNumber.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/beanvalidation/SerialNumber.java[]
----

The [hotspot=Target file=1]`@Target` annotation indicates the element types to which you can 
apply the custom constraint. Because the [hotspot=serial-num file=0]`@SerialNumber` constraint is 
used only on a field, only the [hotspot=Target file=1]`FIELD` target is specified.

When you define a constraint annotation, the specification requires the [hotspot=Retention file=1]`RUNTIME` 
retention policy.

The [hotspot=Constraint file=1]`@Constraint` annotation specifies the class that contains the 
validation logic for the custom constraint.

In the [hotspot=SerialNumber file=1]`SerialNumber` body, the [hotspot=message file=1]`message()` 
method provides the message that is output when a validation constraint is violated. The 
[hotspot=groups file=1]`groups()` and [hotspot=payload file=1]`payload()` methods associate this 
constraint only with certain groups or payloads. The defaults are used in the example.

Now, create the class that provides the validation for the [hotspot=serial-num file=0]`@SerialNumber` 
constraint.

[role='code_command hotspot file=2', subs='quotes']
---- 
#Replace the `SerialNumberValidator` class.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/beanvalidation/SerialNumberValidator.java`
---- 

SerialNumberValidator.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/beanvalidation/SerialNumberValidator.java[]
----

The [hotspot=SerialNumberValidator file=2]`SerialNumberValidator` class has one method, [hotspot=isValid file=2]`isValid()`, 
which contains the custom validation logic. In this case, the serial number must start 
with [hotspot=Liberty file=2]`Liberty` followed by 4 numbers, such as `Liberty0001`. If the 
supplied serial number matches the constraint, [hotspot=isValid file=2]`isValid()` returns 
`true`. If the serial number does not match, it returns `false`.

// ==================================================================================
// Programmatically validating constraints
// ==================================================================================
== Programmatically validating constraints

Finally, create a service that can be used to programmatically validate the constraints
on the [hotspot=Spacecraft file=0]`Spacecraft` and [hotspot=Astronaut file=1]`Astronaut` JavaBeans.

Spacecraft.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/beanvalidation/Spacecraft.java[]
----

Astronaut.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/beanvalidation/Astronaut.java[]
----

[role='code_command hotspot file=2', subs='quotes']
---- 
#Create the `BeanValidationEndpoint` class.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/beanvalidation/BeanValidationEndpoint.java`
---- 

BeanValidationEndpoint.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/beanvalidation/BeanValidationEndpoint.java[]
----

Two resources, a validator and an instance of the [hotspot=Spacecraft file=2]`Spacecraft` JavaBean, 
are injected into the class. The default validator is used and is obtained through CDI
injection. However, you can also obtain the default validator with resource injection
or a JNDI lookup. The [hotspot=Spacecraft file=0]`Spacecraft` JavaBean is injected so that the 
method-level constraints can be validated.

The programmatic validation takes place in the [hotspot=validate-Spacecraft file=2]`validateSpacecraft()` 
method. To validate the data, the [hotspot=validate file=2]`validate()` method is called on the 
[hotspot=Spacecraft file=0]`Spacecraft` bean. Because the [hotspot=Spacecraft file=0]`Spacecraft` 
bean contains the [hotspot=Valid file=0]`@Valid` constraint on the [hotspot=Astronaut file=1]`Astronaut` 
bean, both JavaBeans are validated. Any constraint violations found during the call to 
the [hotspot=validate file=2]`validate()` method are returned as a set of [hotspot=ConstraintViolation file=2]`ConstraintViolation` 
objects.

The method level validation occurs in the [hotspot=launchSpacecraft file=2]`launchSpacecraft()` method. 
A call is then made to the [hotspot=launchSpacecraft file=0]`launchSpacecraft()` method on the 
[hotspot=Spacecraft file=0]`Spacecraft` bean, which throws a `ConstraintViolationException` 
exception if either of the method-level constraints is violated.

== Enabling the Bean Validation feature

Enable the Bean Validation feature in the application by updating the `server.xml` configuration file.

[role="code_command", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `server` configuration file.#
`src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`

The `beanValidation` feature definition enables the bean validation feature in the
application so that you can use it to validate that the supplied JavaBeans meet the defined constraints.

Expand the `/beanvalidation/validatespacecraft POST request to validate your spacecraft bean`
section and click `Try it out`. Copy the following example input into the text box:

[role='command']
```
{
  "astronaut": {
    "name": "Libby",
    "age": 25,
    "emailAddress": "libbybot@openliberty.io"
  },
  "destinations": {
    "Mars": 500
  },
  "serialNumber": "Liberty0001"
}
```

Click `Execute` and you receive the response `No Constraint Violations` because
the values specified pass previously defined constraints.

Next, modify the following values, all of which break the previously defined
constraints:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
Age = 10
Email = libbybot
SerialNumber = Liberty1
----

After you click `Execute`, the response contains the following constraint
violations:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
Constraint Violation Found: serial number is not valid.
Constraint Violation Found: must be greater than or equal to 18
Constraint Violation Found: must be a well-formed email address
----

To try the method-level validation, expand the `/beanvalidation/launchspacecraft POST request to specify a launch code` section.
Enter `OpenLiberty` in the text box. Note that `launched` is returned because the launch code passes the defined
constraints. Replace `OpenLiberty` with anything else to note that a constraint
violation is returned.

BeanValidationIT.java

----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/beanvalidation/BeanValidationIT.java[]
----

The [hotspot=BeforeEach file=0]`@BeforeEach` annotation causes the [hotspot=setup file=0]`setup()` method 
to execute before the test cases. The [hotspot=setup file=0]`setup()` method retrieves the 
port number for the Open Liberty server and creates a [hotspot=Client file=0]`Client` that is 
used throughout the tests, which are described as follows:

* The [hotspot=testNoFieldLevelConstraintViolations file=0]`testNoFieldLevelConstraintViolations()` test case verifies that constraint violations do not occur when valid data is supplied to the [hotspot=Astronaut file=0]`Astronaut` and [hotspot=Spacecraft file=0]`Spacecraft` bean attributes.

* The [hotspot=testFieldLevelConstraintViolation file=0]`testFieldLevelConstraintViolation()` test case verifies that the appropriate constraint violations occur when data that is supplied to the `Astronaut` and `Spacecraft` attributes violates the defined constraints. Because 3 constraint violations are defined, 3 `ConstraintViolation` objects are returned as a set from the [hotspot=Response file=0]`validate` call. The 3 expected messages are [hotspot=expectedDestinationResponse file=0]`"must be greater than 0"` for the negative distance specified in the destination map, [hotspot=expectedEmailResponse file=0]`"must be a well-formed email address"` for the incorrect email address, and the custom [hotspot=expectedSerialNumberResponse file=0]`"serial number is not valid"` message for the serial number.

* The [hotspot=testNoMethodLevelConstraintViolations file=0]`testNoMethodLevelConstraintViolations()` test case verifies that the method-level constraints that are specified on the [hotspot=launchSpacecraft file=1]`launchSpacecraft()` method of the [hotspot=Spacecraft file=1]`Spacecraft` bean are validated when the method is called with no violations. In this test, the call to the [hotspot=launchSpacecraft file=0]`launchSpacecraft()` method is made with the [hotspot=OpenLiberty file=0]`OpenLiberty` argument. A value of `true` is returned, which passes the specified constraints.

* The [hotspot=testMethodLevelConstraintViolation file=0]`testMethodLevelConstraintViolation()` test case verifies that a `ConstraintViolationException` exception is thrown when one of the method-level constraints is violated. A call with an incorrect parameter, [hotspot=incorrectCode file=0]`incorrectCode`, is made to the [hotspot=launchSpacecraft file=1]`launchSpacecraft()` method of the [hotspot=Spacecraft file=1]`Spacecraft` bean. The method returns `false`, which violates the defined constraint, and a `ConstraintViolationException` exception is thrown. The exception includes the constraint violation message, which in this example is [hotspot=actualResponse file=0]`must be true`.
